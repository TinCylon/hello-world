# hello-world
Learning Git / start of coding
This is the start of me learning to code!!!
I'm starting of with CS50 to get a base in computer science along with running through some GitHub tutorials
(hence this hello-world repository)
think im going to start free code camp after those, and then focus more on phython and javascript before consolidating and finishing off my portfolio.
I'll start looking at interviews then, but thats a long way of yet so just gonna enjoy learning and solving each problem as we go!
